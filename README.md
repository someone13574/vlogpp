This program converts Verilog modules into C preprocessor macros which evaulate the output at preprocessor-time. Is has no use cases other than generating horrendous, unreadable macros which can do things that could easily be done by a code generator or at runtime. It uses yosys to generate the netlists, and then compute a DAG from that. At its core it makes use of token concatencation to lookup results of gates within small lookup tables, and then shares partial results by passing them to deeper layers of macros. It will use varadic macros to hide passthrough arguments. It also supports sequential circuits for a limited number of repetitions by using evaluation multiplication and some tricks to allow recursive macro calls. See the tests folder for how to use the library. Also note that the C preprocessor was absolutely not made for this, so it is horribly inefficient at executing it. Lastly, there is a obfuscation mode which can be toggled in the Cargo.toml, which randomly orders the different macros, their arguments, and gives them random names so that the output is even less understandable; not that it was really readable in the first place.
